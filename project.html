            <h4 class="text">
                <b>• Main use of this project is to detect the objects at any type. We can detect with in seconds using YOLO with RCNN.
                 <br> using this we can detect images,create images.
                 <br/><br/>• Yolo gives better output and taking less speed than others.&nbsp; 
                 Because of getting more images than normal object <br/>detection using YOLO with the darknet. 
                 <br/><br/>•Darknet using best data set for it is coco data set. In that we are taking around 80 types of object details given.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>• In this darknet using config and weights of the objects. Main technologoeis deep neural network taking here <br/>to detect the objects.
                 <br/><br/>• Finally, we are getting best output than other technologies.
                Basically, clear vision is very important at foggy times. We need <br/>to enhance the image or video we can easily see the output. So, we need to develop some techniques for the dehaze input.<br/> And identify the image at time of foggy climate. That purpose we need a feature calculation. Using this we can easily <br/>overcome the accidents at any places.

        <p class="text">
           <b>•The Project Aims In Designing A Robot Which Is Capable Of Detecting ObjectsAnd Manholes In The Path And Alerts The User Through Buzzer Alarm System .This Robot Helps A Lot For Blind People In Detecting The ManholesAnd Any Obstacles In Their Path And Avoiding Them
        
        <p class="text">
          • The Controlling Device Of Whole System Is Microcontroller,Ultrasonic Sensor, UltrasSonic Range finder And Buzzer Are Interfaced To The Microcontroller.The User Can Switch ON The  Robot.The Microcontroller Continuously Gets Input From The Ultrasonic Sensor And Ultrasonic Range Finder.The Microcontroller Judges The Obstacles And Manholes And Alerts Through Buzzer In Case Of Obstacle And Alarm In Case Of Manholes.
